# Introduction

This document describes the relying party service interface protocol of Smart-ID server and
provides information for integration. The interface offers the entry point to Smart-ID main use
cases, i.e. authentication and signing.

The interface is to be used by relaying parties - parties who wish to use Smart-ID services,
i.e. ask end users to perform authentication and signing operations.

## 1.1 Glossary

* Smart-ID account - A person has to register a Smart-ID account to use services provided by the Smart-ID
  system. Account binds a Smart-ID app instance (installed on a person's mobile device)
  to a person's identity in the Smart-ID system. In the course of account creation and
  registration, the identity of the account owner (person) is proofed by a Registration
  Authority (RA) and the relation between the identity and a key pair is certified by a
  Certificate Authority (CA). An account has a signature key pair and an authentication
  key pair.
* Smart-ID app - A technical component of the Smart-ID system. A mobile app instance installed on a
  person's mobile device that provides access to Smart-ID functionality for persons.
* Smart-ID provider - An organization that is legally responsible for the Smart-ID system.
* Smart-ID server - A technical component of the Smart-ID system. Server-side counterpart of the Smart-ID
  app. Handles backend operations and provides API-s to Relying Party (RP).
* Smart-ID system - A technical and organizational environment, which enables digital authentication and
  issuing of digital signatures of persons in an electronic environment. The Smart-ID
  system provides services that allow persons (Smart-ID account owners) to authenticate
  themselves to RPs, to give digital signatures requested by RPs, and to manage their
  Smart-ID accounts.
* Authentication key pair (or authentication key) - Key pair, which is used to digitally authenticate a person.
* Certificate Authority (CA) - An entity that issues certificates for Smart-ID account owners.
* Key pair - Pair of keys, which are required for digital signature scheme. There are two kinds of key
  pairs (or shortly, keys) in the Smart-ID system, authentication key pair and signature key
  pair. The word pair refers to to the private and public keys of each key pair used in an
  assymetric cryptographic algorithm, here RSA.
* Mobile device - A tablet computer or smartphone that runs a mobile device operating system (Apple iOS,
  Google Android).
* Person - A natural person who uses the Smart-ID system to authenticate herself to an RP and to
  issue digital signatures requested by RP.
* Registration Authority (RA) - An entity responsible for recording or verifying some or all of the information (particularly
  the identities of subjects) needed by a CA to issue certificates and CRLs and to perform
  other certificate management functions.
* Relying Party (RP) - An organization or service, for example a bank, which is using the Smart-ID service to
  authenticate its users and to get them to sign the documents.
* Relying Party request - A request from an RP that requires some kind of operation in the Smart-ID backend
  system. It may or may not create a transaction.
* Signature key pair (or signature key) - Key pair, which is used to give digital signatures of a person.
